            NFT is a Non-Fungible Token. Non-Fungible meaning it has a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied. This unique identifier is on the Ethereum blockchain restricting change and showing public proof of ownership with the buyer.<br>

                 <div>
                        <p>
                            The first NFT fully-fledged project was Etheria which were purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They went unsold until March 13, 2021. That was when the NFT buying spree commenced. All those tiles were sold at $1.3 Million dollars, if they were bought at the time of release it would have been around $197. That would discredit the public awareness it gained during 2017. This isn’t wikipedia so I won’t dabble on the history too much!
                        </p>
                        <p>NFTs can be anything, a GIF, a video, music, a 3D house, your medical records, four pixels, etc. You get the point.</p>

                 <div class="project">
                 <h2><u>Pros</u></h2>
                 <div> 
                    <p>
                    1. IMMUTABILITY-   NFTs can’t be changed or replaced in any way if their authenticity is verified on the blockchain. The intrinsic value of authenticity becomes an actual, extrinsic value, as well</div>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. SMART CONTRACT-  The heart and soul of blockchain technology — make automatic executions after certain events possible. For example, if the NFT owner resells it for a profit later and the artist attached a royalty “rider” to the contract, the artist gets compensated immediately
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3.NEW COMMUNITY- NFTs also unlock new possibilities for artists and creators to share commissions, collect resale royalties, host and curate their own creations, and break down barriers created by legacy institutions.

                    The peer-to-peer relationship between creator and patron through NFTs can help foster new landscapes for engagement and connection for creators, fans, and audiences.

                <div class="project">
                 <h2><u>Cons</u></h2>
                 <div><p>1. ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION- The biggest downside would be how much power usage it takes to make and do transactions with blockchain. In 2011 a simple computer would mine bitcoin with little electricity. Now it’s a different story. There are multiple mining farms that mine 24/7.
                      </p>
<p>
  2.UNSURE RETURNS-NFT worth is entirely tied to aesthetic and sentimental value. It’s impossible to gauge its worth as a long-term investment, so right now, it’s nothing but speculation.
</p>

<p>
    3.MONEY LAUNDERING- Due to it’s anonymity that anonymity, especially when paired with a relatively new technology, fosters an environment ripe for money laundering.Someone looking to “clean” dirty money could theoretically generate an anonymous NFT; list it for sale on the blockchain; purchase it from himself/herself from an anonymous, unregulated digital wallet with illicit funds; and then recognize the money as legitimate funds from the sale of the artwork.

                <div> 
                    <p>There is no doubt that blockchain technology offers secure documents with a transparent transaction. <br>  <br>

                        Yet can we ignore its carbon footprint? <br> <br>
                        
                        Bill Gates even expressed concern over the amount of energy consumption. Bitcoin supporters say that estimates of its carbon footprint are overstated. <br> <br>
                        
                        And if the computers that mine and help transact bitcoins are attached to an electric grid that uses wind and solar power, they add, mining and using it will become cleaner over time. <br><br>
                    Following are some solutions to reduce these negative effects:</p> 
                   <p>
                    1. REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION- Tezos is a company working on making clean NFT with drastically lower energy consumption, 
                    the energy used annually by validators of the Tezos network  is in the range of 60MWh, a continuous draw of 7 kilowatts.
                    Compared to Ethereum, these numbers differ by a factor of over two million, between six and seven orders of magnitude. </div>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   2. REDUCED CARBON FOOTPRINT-  The solution is to move to a blockchain based on proof of stake, where the number of validators and the amount of energy they consume is many orders of magnitude less than that required by proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   3. HONORING CREATOR SHARES- The solution is to integrate the payment method more deeply with the triggering of the transfer, so that a neutral protocol running in the blockchain is responsible for transferring the title of the work only if the preconditions of paying out the creator shares and sell-on shares are satisfied.

                   The peer-to-peer relationship between creator and patron through NFTs can help foster new landscapes for engagement and connection for creators, fans, and audiences.
